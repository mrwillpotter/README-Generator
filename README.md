# README-Generator

This application functions as a Node read-me generator by prompting the user with a series of questions that will populate a markdown document. The user is asked about details regarding their GitHub username, email, title of the project, a description of the project, the project license, command prompts to install dependencies, as well as details regarding  making contributions to the repo. Once the user completes the inquirer prompt, the application writes a new markdown file and populates the markdown file with the user's answers.
